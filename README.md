# Marvin Voice Assistant Implementation

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation code for the Marvin voice assistant, modeled to function similarly to popular voice assistants like Amazon's Alexa or Apple's Siri. The project integrates various models to handle tasks such as wake word detection, speech transcription, language model querying, and speech synthesis.

## Guidance and Assistance
This project was completed under the guidance of **Dr. Ajay Bandi** and with the assistance of **Hemanth Sai Kagitha** and **Pravallika Mummadi** as part of the Generative AI course at  **North West Missouri State Univeristy**.

## Tools Used
The implementation of Marvin involves several tools, each crucial for different stages of the voice assistant pipeline:

- üé§ **Wake Word Detection**: A small, efficient audio classification model.
- üìù **Speech Transcription**: An on-device automatic speech recognition (ASR) model.
- üß† **Language Model Query**: Cloud-based large language models (LLMs).
- üó£Ô∏è **Synthesise Speech**: Text-to-speech (TTS) model for generating spoken output.

## Repository Link
The complete implementation of the Marvin voice assistant is available on GitHub. You can access the repository and review the code [here](https://github.com/Jitender-Singh-NWM/Marvin.git).
